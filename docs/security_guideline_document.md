# Secure Guidelines for Personal Document Indexing & AI Retrieval System

This document provides security guidelines to protect your data throughout design, implementation, deployment, and operations phases. It aligns with core principles—Security by Design, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, Fail Securely, and Secure Defaults—to build a robust, trustworthy solution.

## 1. Architecture Overview

*   **Data Sources**: Local machines (MacBook Air, iMac), Synology NAS, Yandex Disk, Google Drive
*   **Processing & Storage**: Self-hosted server (8 GB RAM, 120 GB SSD), Docker containers, vector database (e.g., Qdrant)
*   **Interfaces**: Claude Desktop plugin, Telegram bot, Web dashboard (React/Next.js + FastAPI or Node.js)
*   **Sync & Backup**: Cron jobs, Docker Compose, Git for code, Synology NAS for backups

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

*   **Server Access**:

    *   Enforce SSH key-based login; disable password authentication
    *   Restrict SSH to specific IPs or via VPN only
    *   Create dedicated, non-root users for services; assign minimal Unix permissions

*   **API & Services**:

    *   Issue unique service accounts/tokens for each component (embedding API, vector DB, drive sync)
    *   Store secrets in a vault or Docker secrets; avoid plaintext credentials in code or env files
    *   Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the vector DB and any external APIs

*   **Web Dashboard & Telegram Bot**:

    *   Use OAuth2 or JWT for user sessions; sign tokens with strong secrets (HS256+ or RS256)
    *   Enforce HTTPS and set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` on cookies
    *   Implement CSRF protection (Synchronizer tokens or Double Submit Cookie)
    *   Rate-limit endpoints to prevent brute-force and DoS

## 3. Data Protection & Encryption

*   **Encryption in Transit**:

    *   Enforce TLS ≥1.2 for all services (Let's Encrypt certificates)
    *   Use SSH/SFTP with strong ciphers for backups and remote sync

*   **Encryption at Rest**:

    *   Enable full-disk encryption on server and NAS
    *   Encrypt sensitive data in the vector database (Qdrant encryption feature or OS-level)
    *   Store embeddings and summaries on encrypted volumes

*   **Sensitive Data Handling**:

    *   Hash any stored passwords with Argon2 or bcrypt + unique salts
    *   Mask PII in logs and avoid verbose error messages containing stack traces or paths

## 4. Infrastructure & Network Security

*   **Firewall & Network Segmentation**:

    *   Expose only necessary ports: e.g., 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH via VPN), block all others
    *   Deploy UFW or iptables with default deny inbound policy
    *   Place the server behind a hardware/software firewall; isolate the NAS on a separate VLAN

*   **VPN Access**:

    *   Require VPN (OpenVPN/WireGuard) for administrative access and NAS sync
    *   Use strong PSKs and rotate keys periodically

*   **Service Hardening**:

    *   Disable unused services and remove default accounts
    *   Keep the OS and packages updated (apt/yum upgrades, Docker image rebuilds)
    *   Scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., `docker scan`, SCA tools)

## 5. Application Security

*   **Input Validation & Output Encoding**:

    *   Validate all file metadata and document content server-side (size, type, extension)
    *   Sanitize extracted text before embedding or display to avoid injection
    *   Enforce allow-lists for redirect URLs

*   **File Upload & Conversion**:

    *   Process conversions in an isolated container or sandbox
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware (ClamAV) before ingestion
    *   Store interim conversion files outside the webroot with strict file permissions

*   **Security Headers & CSP**:

    *   `Content-Security-Policy` to restrict scripts/styles
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
    *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`

*   **Third-Party Scripts**:

    *   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN assets
    *   Maintain minimal dependencies; review each library’s security track record

## 6. API & Service Controls

*   **Rate Limiting & Quotas**:

    *   Enforce per-user and per-service rate limits (e.g., 100 req/min)
    *   Return `429 Too Many Requests` when thresholds exceeded

*   **CORS**:

    *   Restrict origins to your domains (e.g., `https://your-dashboard.example.com`)
    *   Disallow wildcard (`*`) in production

*   **Versioning & Deprecation**:

    *   Prefix APIs with `/v1/`, `/v2/` to manage changes safely
    *   Document breaking changes and sunset old versions securely

## 7. Backup, Monitoring & Incident Response

*   **Automated Backups**:

    *   Schedule encrypted backups of the vector store and raw files to Synology NAS
    *   Verify backup integrity with checksums
    *   Retain multiple recovery points (e.g., daily for 7 days, weekly for 4 weeks)

*   **Logging & Monitoring**:

    *   Aggregate logs (authentication, API usage, sync jobs) in a secure logging service or ELK stack
    *   Monitor unusual activity: failed logins, burst API usage, sync errors
    *   Configure alerts for critical failures (disk full, high memory, unauthorized access)

*   **Incident Response Plan**:

    *   Document procedures for credential rotation, service isolation, data restoration
    *   Periodically test recovery workflows (disaster drills)

## 8. Operational Best Practices

*   **Least Privilege**:

    *   Review and reduce permissions quarterly for service accounts and users

*   **Change Management**:

    *   Use Git with lockfiles (`Pipfile.lock`, `package-lock.json`) for reproducible builds
    *   Code reviews emphasizing security implications before merge

*   **Dependency Updates**:

    *   Automate vulnerability scans (Dependabot, Snyk) and apply patches promptly

*   **Documentation & Training**:

    *   Maintain an updated Security Playbook and onboarding guide
    *   Train personnel (even if a small team) on phishing, credential hygiene, and incident reporting

By following these guidelines, you ensure that your personal document indexing and AI retrieval system remains secure, resilient, and aligned with industry best practices. Regularly revisit and update this document as your architecture evolves or as new threats emerge.
