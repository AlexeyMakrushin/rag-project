It looks like you’ve captured all the high-level requirements. Before I draft the 50-step implementation plan, could you confirm or clarify the following?

1.  Indexing cadence – Would you prefer a continuous watch (e.g. using inotify/rclone hooks) or a scheduled batch (cron/systemd timer)?
2.  Embedding API choice – Should I lock in OpenAI Embeddings v2.0 now (with switch-to-local placeholder), or leave the API provider generic?
3.  Qdrant deployment – Do you want it containerized only on the Linux server, or also on your Mac for local dev?
4.  Telegram bot tech – Python (FastAPI backend + python-telegram-bot) or Node.js?
5.  VPN/SSH setup – Any existing VPN stack (WireGuard/OpenVPN) you’d like to integrate, or should I include a fresh WireGuard guide?
6.  Future multi-user scope – Shall we stub out user model and auth now, or defer until the “personal use” MVP is solid?

Once you’re happy with these details, I’ll produce the full, phase-by-phase Implementation Plan. Let me know!
